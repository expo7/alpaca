You are working inside my full-stack trading project located at ~/Desktop/alpaca.

Project layout:
- stockscores/ -> Django backend with Celery, paper trading, strategy execution (StrategyViewSet.execute, execute_strategy_task, StrategyRunner.evaluate).
- rank-ui/ -> React + Vite frontend with Vitest tests. Key pages: StrategyBuilder, Orders, Leaderboards, Auth (Landing/Login).
- docker-compose.yml + Dockerfile configure web, worker, beat, Postgres, Redis.

Current state:
- Strategy execution is wired: StrategyViewSet.execute enqueues execute_strategy_task (queue="strategy"), enforces caps (single/gross via entry quantity_pct), and returns queued metadata (status, queued_via, execution_id).
- Frontend has tests in rank-ui/src/__tests__ for StrategyBuilder, Orders, Leaderboards, and some auth/routing components; Vitest + Testing Library are set up.
- .gitignore is configured to ignore rank-ui/node_modules, rank-ui/dist, rank-ui/coverage, logs, and other build artifacts.

From now on in this workspace, assume this context and follow existing patterns and file structure when you:
- Add new backend endpoints or Celery tasks.
- Wire new frontend pages or API calls in rank-ui.
- Add or modify Vitest tests.
- Suggest changes to Docker or docker-compose.
